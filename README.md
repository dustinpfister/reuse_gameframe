# Finger Lakes Reuse GameFrame

The aim of this project is to create a chrome extension that provides a standard framework for running video games that are driven largely by production data, rather than user input. The extension provides various built in functionality that has to do with scraping production data from the pricing stats sections of the IRC, and RMC store locations, cleaning it up, and presenting it as part of a state that can then be accessed within the body of code that composes a 'GAME ROM'. A game rom is just simply a standardized body of code that runs on top of the framework, and will do various things with a current pull of pricing state data.

## Design Goals of the ROMS

Things are going to be a little tricky when it comes to designing the ROMS for this project. The games should not be distracting from work, but should boost morale and thus, in theory at least, production.

* Be interesting enough to get people engaged with the game.
* Not be so interesting that it negatively impacts production, and other work actual work duties.
* Should have very little or no user input \( zero player game \) 

## Project History

## R0  ( done 10/17/2025 ) - Core Idea of Project working

With R0 the goal was just to quickly get the core idea of the framework, and a single test Rom working on top of it called just simply 'meter'. So far so good, but there is a great deal more work to get done with this. One thing that I do not have finalized at this point is a standard for how the roms will exist.
